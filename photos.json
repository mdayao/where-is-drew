Walked to pick up some food and supplies, I somehow ended up with like 17lbs of food \ud83d\ude05. then took a bus and shuttle to the trail. Before I even stepped foot on the trail I ended up with a pocket full of yogurt \ud83e\udd23. Hike started with a big climb to a beautiful vista at McAfees knob. There looks to be tons of bouldering potential around the knob. Then kept hiking past Tinker cliffs, another beautiful vista, with lots of short trad potential. Stayed the night at Lamberts meadow shelter"

The roller coaster was somewhat similar to the Rachel Carson Trail in Pittsburgh, PA, but lacked the steepness that the RCT has. All of the hills on the roller coaster were as tall as the tallest hill on the RCT. As soon as you got up the hill, you just go right back down the other side.
