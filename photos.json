Walked to pick up some food and supplies, I somehow ended up with like 17lbs of food \ud83d\ude05. then took a bus and shuttle to the trail. Before I even stepped foot on the trail I ended up with a pocket full of yogurt \ud83e\udd23. Hike started with a big climb to a beautiful vista at McAfees knob. There looks to be tons of bouldering potential around the knob. Then kept hiking past Tinker cliffs, another beautiful vista, with lots of short trad potential. Stayed the night at Lamberts meadow shelter"

    "message": "Challenged myself to a 29.6 mile day today, so I started hiking shortly after sunrise. Not even halfway through my hike, I met my first trail angel: Four Feet. He had set up at a trailhead with a cooler full of drinks, 4 different bins full of snacks and candy, a box full of fried chicken, and some cornbread. I stopped, ate about 1000 calories worth of food, and grabbed some candy bars to go. I kept moving until Port Clinton, PA, where I stopped at the local barber shop: a hiker friendly hangout spot. At the barber shop, they had free cookies and Gatorade powder for hikers along with walls full of antiques, collectible coins, and racks of guitars. After getting my fill of cookies, I was informed of a gourmet grilled cheese food truck that was on my way out of town, so I had to stop. I designed my own grilled cheese with a fried egg and every veggie they had in the truck and ate it within minutes. Then I hiked as fast as I could to the shelter to make sure I got there before sundown. After climbing out of Port Clinton, I started noticing rubbing issues with both of my feet due to the sweaty socks I was wearing all day. I added moleskin, but it didn't seem to help. Finally made it to the shelter, successfully completing my 29.6 mile challenge, but my feet were rubbed raw in several spots. Learned a valuable lesson about switching out socks often when it's hot and there is lots of sweat."

I was a bit worried about seeing rattlesnakes all day because a section hiker showed me a picture of a 30 inch long rattlesnake he saw the day before when he was going the other way on this section of the trail. Pretty quickly made it to the steep, rocky incline to Pulpit Rock with a great view. Then I continued moving through more rocks to the Pinnacle with a large black snake sunbathing in the bushes and another great view. There were lots of day hikers at both Pulpit Rock and the Pinnacle. Most of the day consisted of rocks on the trail, ranging anywhere from fist size to full on talus fields. Learned from yesterday that I need to switch socks every 2 hours and let the other socks dry on my pack, which worked out very well for my feet. Met Moon and Tiedye at the shelter who were SOBO section hikers. Moon had previously thru hiked and gave me a lot of good advice about the trail."

Accidentally hiked right past the scrambling opportunity at Bear Rocks because it didn't seem big enough. Made it to Bake Oven Knob with a lovely view where I stopped for a quick break. After lunch I started seeing smoke from a large forest fire in the distance and even heard planes flying over to try to put out the fire. Eventually, I made it to my shelter for the night, which had the trail going right in front of it. The trail there seemed to be a popular day hiking spot, so people kept walking by until dark with lots of people asking me about thru hiking."

I stopped into Bert's restaurant for a hearty breakfast and then went to the local grocery for a resupply and some donuts from the gourmet donut shop inside. After walking back from my detour, I was faced with a huge climb out of Lehigh Gap. I thought the climb was super fun and had some nearly vertical sections that almost required climbing like moves. Once I got to the top, I met a Mennonite family that gave me a honey bun. Then, I ran into a trail crew that was smashing all the big rocks into smaller rocks (not sure why that is preferred, I definitely like the larger rocks). The rest of the way to the shelter was just sharp, small, painful rocks that beat up my feet for the next 10 miles. Made it to the shelter, which already had 2 people camping in it. One more, Crazy B, came in later and joined us for the night."

The first 10 miles were more sharp, pointy rocks with a descent into Wind Gap and an ascent right back out of it. Eventually, I made it to Wolf Rocks, a cool rocky ridgeline but sadly without a view. Afterwards, I popped out onto a nice and mostly flat gravel road that took me to the summit of Mt Minsi. Mt Minsi had a great view of the Delaware River to the South. I descended into Delaware Water Gap to a free hostel at the local church. There, I met up with 2 of the people from the shelter last night, Crazy B and Two Ts, who were injured and took a shuttle to the hostel. Eventually, FB made it to the hostel, the final person from the shelter last night. I did laundry at the hotel down the road, combining some clothes from the other hikers since it was a large washer and dryer. Took a shower at the hostel, which had disposable body towels. Then Crazy B treated FB, Two Ts, and me to a dinner at the local pizza and Italian joint where I got an eggplant parmesan. Crazy B also provided us an Apple Pie from the local pie shop for dessert."

Luckily, the climb into New Jersey had much fewer rocks than the past couple of days, and the rocks that did exist were much less sharp. After hiking up into NJ I made it to Sunfish Pond. I met a group of dayhikers and one of them told me he was the 1000th person to thru hike the AT in the 1980s. He gave me nearly every snack he had in his daypack and said he would just take food from his buddies' packs. I stopped at the AMC Mohican Center for a chickpea salad wrap for lunch. The day was hot, but thankfully there were many more water sources in NJ than most of PA. Hiked with a group of section hikers for an hour of the day. When I got to the shelter, FB, Crazy B, and Two Ts were all already there. Crazy B got me a bagel with cream cheese on her ride over to the shelter that Two Ts carried in for me."

Walked across the road to the general store where I got an egg and cheese sandwich for second breakfast. As I kept walking down the trail, I once again walked into NY while in the Wallkill nature preserve. Made it to the nearly 1 mi long boardwalk in NJ where I saw a huge turtle munching on an apple someone dropped. Right after the boardwalk, I stopped at Heavenly Hills farm, where I got ice cream, apple cider donuts, and cheese. Ate everything except for the cheese and then was faced with the stairway to heaven, a 1000 ft rocky ascent. After the stairway was a great view of the valley below. I kept walking and found some trail magic, someone had left a box of root beers for the hikers and I quickly drank one. Kept walking to Warwick Turnpike where I was picked up by David. He had snacks and cold drinks ready in the car for me knowing I would be hungry. We stopped by the grocery store on the way back to his house so I could resupply. At his house I was able to take a luxurious shower and do my laundry. Lisa, David's wife, made an amazing meal of Salmon, baked sweet potatoes, and broccoli. We then had cheesecake, cannolis, and fruit for dessert. I then slept on a nice and comfortable bed for the first time."

The hike started on a boardwalk, but eventually, I was on a rocky ridgetop that would bring me into New York for good. Due to the on and off rain, the rocks were slippery. I slipped once while eating the veggie wrap and a second time even while using both poles. NY started with the highest point on the trail in the state. I saw a cool orange newt on the trail. After a while, the rain stopped, and I came down from the ridgetop. I decided to stop by Bellvalle Farms creamery and got a delicious scoop of ice cream on a waffle cone. As I was finishing my ice cream, a man walked up to me and asked if I was a thru hiker. I responded, \"Yes,\" he handed me $10 and gave me his email so I could send him pictures of the trail. It was only 3 miles until the shelter where I had the half cheesecake for dinner. It thunderstormed and downpoured for 30 minutes right before bed, but then didn't rain anymore."

Started hiking towards Bear Mountain, which had a tower with great views in every direction. Then, I descended the mountain to the zoo. I saw my first bear on trail, but he was too sleepy to care. I also saw a porcupine, fox, muskrat, hawks, owls, and a peregrine falcon. After the zoo I made a 1 mile detour to a pizza place in Fort Montgomery. I had a whole large cheese pizza to myself. Then I crossed the Hudson and climbed back onto the ridgetop. Wasn't the smartest idea to eat a whole pizza before finishing the day, but I made it through the remaining 6 miles. Passed the Appalachian Market, a gas station with a deli inside. I got a chocolate milk and continued to the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center's Ballfield. Set up my tent for the first time in a while, charged my phone at the pavilion, and I got some snacks from the hiker box. At around dinner time I jogged the mile back (without my pack) to the Appalachian Market, got an egg and cheese sandwich and half a quesadilla, and walked back to my tent.

The first shelter with houses on both sides. The shelter had access to the road, so I got a large veggie pizza and a salad courtesy of FB.

Walked through the Appalachian Trail train station, and then I was at the road I challenged myself to get to and it was only 3 pm.

I drank half the milk and ate most of the pastries, then continued back on the trail. Immediately after town I was faced with a steep climb to the top of Lion's Head. After summiting Lion's Head with a nice view there was a relatively flat section for a couple miles. Following the flat section, I climbed Bear Mountain (interesting that both NY and CT have a Bear Mountain on the trail). When I got to the summit of Bear Mountain, I finished my milk and was gifted a handful of chocolates by some dayhikers. The descent off the summit was quite rocky, necessitating a slower pace. I crossed the CT-MA border shortly after the rocks disappeared. Then I walked into Sage's Ravine, a beautiful, green ravine full of waterfalls. The ravine was much cooler than the ridgeline. Ran into FB and we started hiking together. Our next task was summitting Mt Race, which had a pretty gentle ascent. I left FB behind to go at my normal pace and walked along the precarious cliff line at the top of Mt Race. After summiting Mt Race, a thunderstorm quickly started rolling in. It started pouring rain as I started my climb up the final and tallest mountain, Mt Everett. The trail turned into waterfalls and streams as I climbed the mountain. There was thunder and lightning, but I was counting the timing between them to make sure the storm was far away as I was summiting Mt Everett. When I summitted the rain let up for a bit, but it resumed quickly as I descended. I took a break from the rain at the next shelter and ate some snacks. When I got back to hiking, I caught up to FB, who ended up ahead of me when I stopped. Lucky for us, the rain let up, but the trail was still a giant puddle. We hiked the rest of the way together to the highway since FB had a hotel in town and was letting me crash on the other queen bed.

The trail blazes today were much more frequent than they were last evening, so there must have been an issue with just a small section. The morning hike was a blur until the steep descent down to cross VT 9. Due to all the wet, I slipped once my way down, but thankfully, nothing was injured. I climbed back out after the road crossing, going up nearly the same height as I came down. I kept climbing until I reached my shelter on the side of Glastenbury Mountain. When I got to the shelter, I realized all my clothes had gotten wet through my rain jacket and rain pants. I just took everything off and crawled into my sleeping bag. I stayed there for most of the evening until I went to bed."

I was at the top of Glastenbury Mountain within 10 minutes of starting the day. The trail was mostly downhill for the next 12 miles. Unfortunately, the trail was still mostly a giant puddle. I ran into the first hiker I had seen for the past 36 hours or so. Then, I was tasked with climbing 2,000 ft to summit Stratton Mountain.  There were a decent amount of tree blow downs on the climb that I had to bushwhack to get around. At the top of the mountain, I climbed the tower to get a view, but all I saw was the white of clouds in every direction. When I got down off the mountain, I met a group of trail maintainers that were surprised I didn't see any snow at the top of the mountain. The mist started clearing up, and the clouds started to open up. I eventually made it to Prospect Rock with an amazing view of Manchester Center, the first view I got since entering VT. The sun was out by the time I made it to the shelter. I was planning on drying out my clothes using the wood stove in the fully enclosed shelter, but I couldn't get any dry wood to start the stove. My clothes had mostly dried during the day as I hiked in them. The only thing that was still wet were my socks and shoes."

Walked up a ski slope that felt very steep, realized when I got to the top of the run that it was only a green run. At the top of Mt Bromley, part of a ski resort, I was able to stop in at the ski patrol warming hut that they keep open. There were working outlets and even a clothes dryer that I dried my socks in. When my phone was charged and the drier was done, I descended the mountain. Due to the amazing weather, lots of dayhikers were out and climbing the mountain. Climbed up a rocky slab to get to Baker Peak. I crossed several streams where the trail maintainers installed a single I-beam as the bridge, which I thought was pretty ingenious. I eventually crossed the Big Black Branch bridge, a large suspension bridge. I was less than a mile from my shelter and ran into a dayhiker on the trail named Ken that I sat down and talked to for a bit about the trail and his recent adventures. I made it to the shelter, which was on the edge of a nice pond in between mountains. I had the whole 12-person shelter to myself for the night."

After an hour of hiking, I made it to White Rocks Cliff with another great view. Not long after, I made it to VT 140 and watched my shuttle driver pull up at the exact same time that I arrived. I had to shuttle around about 6 miles of the trail due to the closure of the Clarendon Gorge bridge. The shuttle dropped me off on VT 103, immediately after the closed bridge. I had a big climb right after the road with a nice amount of rock scrambling. I took a break at the next shelter for lunch and more water. Right after the shelter, the trail seemed to go straight up the next hill (500 ft of ascent in 0.5 mi) , with no switchbacks or anything. Ran into the first thru hikers have seen since entering VT, Sunflower and Just Mike. The end of the day was a 2,000 ft climb over 4 mi to get pretty close to the summit of Mt Killington. There were a ton of blow downs on the ascent, requiring bushwhacking, crawling, climbing, and limbo-ing. Despite my best efforts, I still fell over while going through one of the blow downs. The blow downs definitely made the climb less monotonous, and it went by pretty quickly. Eventually, I made it to the shelter near the peak of Mt. Killington (the closest that the trail got to the peak), it was a fully enclosed but pretty rundown shelter. Just Mike caught back up to me and kept walking to the next shelter. Then, a dayhiker came in and offered me fresh fruit and granola bars that I couldn't say no to."

I walked from the restaurant to the only hostel in town, above the Yellow Deli. At the hostel I did my laundry, took a shower, and charged my devices.

Luckily, the last 3 miles were all easy roadwalking through Norwich, VT and over the river into Hanover. I stopped at a market in Norwich to grab an orange for my shower later (I would recommend a shower orange if you haven't tried one yet). Then I went to a trail angel's house in Hanover that allows hikers to sleep, shower, and do laundry in her basement out of the kindness of her heart. After showering and donning some loaner clothes, I went out for dinner.

Washington, with some of the most unpredictable weather in the US. There were some patches of deep snow on the ascent where I would occasionally post hole up to my thigh. When I got to the summit, the visibility was super low, I tagged the summit and started descending. However, I realized I forgot to send a postcard from the post office on the summit, so I turned around and went back to the summit. Amazingly, the clouds parted as I regained the summit. I was able to see all the buildings on the summit and found the Visitors Center which had a cafeteria as well as the post office. I ate warm food, charged my devices, and sent off the postcard. The good visibility stayed for the remainder of the presidential traverse. Unfortunately, the Appalachian Trail skips most of the summits, but I was still walking above treeline for most of the day. At the end of the traverse I had a big climb up Mt. Madison followed by a steep and rocky 3k ft descent. A bridge over the Madison Gulf was closed, so I took the official detour, which unfortunately skipped Pinkham Notch and the Wildcat mountains. The detour was a nice and easy descent, followed by a gradual ascent up to Carter Notch Hut. I arrived only an hour before sunset, and only the caretaker was there. Another dayhiker showed up a bit later in the dark, and we were the only ones staying at the 40-person hut. The Carter Notch Hut was quite cool, positioned right next to two lakes sandwiched between mountains. It's the oldest hut in the AMC system built in 1914."

I eventually ran into two people who said they were on a rescue mission, and they asked me if I saw anything unusual, which I did not. I thought nothing of it, but then I next saw 6 more people all in the same clothing with walkies and backpacks going in the same direction. Finally, I ran into a group of nearly 15 people lining the trail carrying litters for transporting people, helmets, ropes, and harnesses. At that point, I knew a serious search and rescue mission was going on.  Due to the heavy rain yesterday morning, the river that the trail crossed two times on the descent was quite high. The SAR team had set up handlines to more easily and safely ford the two river crossings, which I appreciated immensely. I made it out to the trailhead on US 2, which was overflowing with SAR vehicles. The Barn Hostel in Gorham, NH picked me up from the trailhead, and I began my normal process of laundry, shower, and resupply. I had pizza in town for lunch, but while I was walking there I was nearly hit by a truck while I crossed the road in a clearly marked crosswalk.

There were nice views back to the White Mountains; I could see the presidential range and the Carter-Wildcat range. The blazes seemed to be quite sparse on this bit of the trail. I eventually made it to my shelter, which was nicely situated next to a pond and had a beautiful view of the mountains straight out of the shelter."

    "message": "Left the shelter with the great view and climbed Mt. Success where I got an even better view of the presidential range. Shortly after, I crossed into Maine, my first time ever in the state. Stopped for lunch on Goose Mountain with amazing views in every direction. A trail maintainer came to the summit while I was eating and gave me some trail magic. I continued hiking and ran into a trail runner who was nearly halfway through the Mahoosuc traverse spanning nearly 30 miles. At some point later, I was walking over some bog boards and slipped on a wet board and landed in the bog. My momentum from the slip kept my head moving towards a nearby tree with a branch poking out. Thankfully, my glasses protected my eye from the branch and deflected it into the corner of my eye where I only sustained a minor scrape. The thing I was looking forward to the most for the day was Mahoosuc Notch, a narrow mile long corridor of large boulders that requires scrambling and is often considered the hardest mile on the trail. The bottom of the notch was still covered in a layer of snow and ice because it was so protected from the sun. I thought the mile was over too fast because I was having so much fun climbing around on the boulders. Immediately following the notch was the climb up Mahoosuc Arm, which started with climbing up through a boulder field and ended with a lot of walking up slabby rock. I ended the day with a descent into a beautiful alpine pond. The shelter was situated right next to the pond. A guy named Cody was at the shelter with his two cattle dogs and had been fishing the pond for the past day. He caught some trout from the pond for dinner and gave me a piece. That fish was some of the best I've ever had, definitely the freshest."

    "message": "Left the shelter and immediately started climbing up Old Speck Mountain. Had pretty decent views from the top of the mountain, but I couldn't see very far because of haze from Canadian wildfires. The descent off the mountain was surprisingly gentle. When I got to the bottom, there was a parking lot with a woman named Pastor Candace, ready to give me trail magic. She took my trash, refilled my hand sanitizer bottle, filled my water, had a cute dog to pet, and gave me as many snacks as I wanted. After the trail magic, I had a big climb up Baldplate Mountain. After the west peak of the mountain, there was a slight descent, and then I was hiking up a long and steep slab of rock to the east peak. The slab continued for a large portion of the descent as well, which was pretty unnerving. After descending the slab, the heat of the day started getting to me. I ran into Chia again, and we hiked together for a couple of miles, which picked my morale back up. He stopped for a long break when we got to Dunn Falls, and I kept hiking. With about 7 miles left until the shelter, I started feeling like I was breaking down. I slowed my pace down significantly, and even then, I was cramping in my thighs. I made it to the shelter and drank a bunch of water (with electrolytes) and ate dinner, which definitely helped me feel better."

    "message": "Woke up feeling pretty destroyed from the previous day of hiking. As soon as I began walking, my legs started to feel like jello. I had a steep downhill from the shelter, dropping 1500 ft in 1.5 miles. Right after getting to the bottom, the trail immediately started climbing back up to about the same height in 0.8 miles. There were a couple of parts on the climb that had rebar handles in the rock to aid in a nearly vertical section of rock. I had to stop frequently on the climb because I was still so dead from yesterday. I eventually made it to the summit of Moody Mountain. The temperature was still hot, and there was still a good amount of haze from the Canadian wildfires. After the summit, there was another (more gentle) descent, which led once again into a steep climb (800 ft of gain in 0.5 miles). After more climbing, at a less serious incline, I summited Old Blue Mountain. Thankfully, after Old Blue, the trail didn't have any more serious ascents or descents for the day. I met an ATC worker at the summit of Bemis Mountain who was cataloging all the large trail maintenance projects that needed to be done in the future. My shelter for the evening was only a bit further, and all downhill from Bemis Mountain. There was a section hiker named Squirrel at the shelter that was on his last section of the trail, going north until Katahdin. He was getting punished by Southern Maine just like I was and was thinking of any way he could drop weight from his pack when he got to the next town."
